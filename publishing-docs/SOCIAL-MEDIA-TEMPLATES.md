Title: [Plugin] Rename Variables — Bulk rename with regex, live preview & collision detection

I built a plugin to make bulk renaming of Figma variables easier and safer.

**Features:**
- Live preview of all changes before applying
- Regex support for complex patterns
- Collision detection (warns about duplicates)
- Filter by variable type (COLOR, FLOAT, STRING, BOOLEAN)
- Filter by collection
- Keyboard shortcuts for fast workflow
- Beautiful, theme-aware UI
- Full undo support

**Use cases:**
- Standardize naming conventions across your design system
- Add/remove prefixes or suffixes
- Clean up imported variables
- Fix inconsistent naming

**Why I built it:**
I was working on a large design system and needed to rename dozens of variables. Doing it manually was tedious and error-prone. This plugin makes it fast and safe.

The plugin is free and available on Figma Community: [Link]

Would love to hear your feedback!
